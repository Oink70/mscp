DESCRIPTION
===========

**mscp** copies files over multiple SSH (SFTP) connections by multiple
threads. It enables transferring (1) multiple files simultaneously and
(2) a large file in parallel, reducing the transfer time for a lot
of/large files over networks.

The usage of **mscp** imitates the **scp** command of *OpenSSH,* for
example:

::

       $ mscp srcfile user@example.com:dstfile

Remote hosts only need to run standard **sshd** supporting the SFTP
subsystem, and users need to be able to **ssh** to the hosts as usual.
**mscp** does not require anything else.

**mscp** uses `libssh <https://www.libssh.org>`__ as its SSH
implementation. Thus, supported SSH features, for example,
authentication, encryption, and various options in ssh_config, follow
what *libssh* supports.

OPTIONS
=======

**-n NR_CONNECTIONS**
   Specifies the number of SSH connections. The default value is
   calculated from the number of CPU cores on the host with the
   following formula: floor(log(nr_cores)*2)+1.

**-m COREMASK**
   Configures CPU cores to be used by the hexadecimal bitmask. All CPU
   cores are used by default.

**-u MAX_STARTUPS**
   Specifies the number of concurrent outgoing SSH connections. **sshd**
   limits the number of simultaneous SSH connection attempts by
   *MaxStartups* in *sshd_config.* The default *MaxStartups* is 10;
   thus, we set the default MAX_STARTUPS 8.

**-I INTERVAL**
   Specifies the interval (in seconds) between SSH connection attempts.
   Some firewall products treat SSH connection attempts from a single
   source IP address for a short period as a brute force attack. This
   option inserts intervals between the attempts to avoid being
   determined as an attack. The default value is 0.

**-s MIN_CHUNK_SIZE**
   Specifies the minimum chunk size. **mscp** divides a file into chunks
   and copies the chunks in parallel.

**-S MAX_CHUNK_SIZE**
   Specifies the maximum chunk size. The default is file size divided by
   the number of connections.

**-a NR_AHEAD**
   Specifies the number of inflight SFTP commands. The default value is
   32.

**-b BUF_SIZE**
   Specifies the buffer size for I/O and transfer over SFTP. The default
   value is 16384. Note that the SSH specification restricts buffer size
   delivered over SSH. Changing this value is not recommended at
   present.

**-4**
   Uses IPv4 addresses only.

**-6**
   Uses IPv6 addresses only.

**-v**
   Increments the verbose output level.

**-q**
   Quiet mode: turns off all outputs.

**-D**
   Dry-run mode: it scans source files to be copied, calculates chunks,
   and resolves destination file paths. Dry-run mode with **-vv** option
   enables confirming files to be copied and their destination paths.

**-r**
   No effect. **mscp** copies recursively if a source path is a
   directory. This option exists for just compatibility.

**-l LOGIN_NAME**
   Specifies the username to log in on the remote machine as with
   *ssh(1).*

**-P PORT**
   Specifies the port number to connect to on the remote machine as with
   ssh(1) and scp(1).

**-F CONFIG**
   Specifies an alternative per-user ssh configuration file. Note that
   acceptable options in the configuration file are what *libssh*
   supports.

**-i IDENTITY**
   Specifies the identity file for public key authentication.

**-c CIPHER**
   Selects the cipher to use for encrypting the data transfer. See
   `libssh features <https://www.libssh.org/features/>`__.

**-M HMAC**
   Specifies MAC hash algorithms. See `libssh
   features <https://www.libssh.org/features/>`__.

**-C COMPRESS**
   Enables compression: yes, no, zlib, zlib@openssh.com. The default is
   none. See `libssh features <https://www.libssh.org/features/>`__.

**-p**
   Preserves modification times and access times (file mode bits are
   preserved by default).

**-H**
   Disables hostkey checking.

**-d**
   Increments the ssh debug output level.

**-N**
   Enables Nagle's algorithm. It is disabled by default.

**-h**
   Prints help.

EXIT STATUS
===========

Exit status is 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

ENVIRONMENT
===========

**mscp** recognizes the following environment variables.

**MSCP_SSH_AUTH_PASSWORD**
   This environment variable passes a password for password
   authentication to establish SSH connections.

**MSCP_SSH_AUTH_PASSPHRASE**
   This environment variable passes a passphrase for public-key
   authentication for establishing SSH connections.

NOTES
=====

**mscp** uses glob(3) for globbing pathnames, including matching
patterns for local and remote paths. However, globbing on the *remote*
side does not work with musl libc (used in Alpine Linux and the
single-binary version of mscp) because musl libc does not support
GLOB_ALTDIRFUNC.

**mscp** does not support remote-to-remote copy, which **scp** supports.

EXAMPLES
========

Copy a local file to a remote host with different name:

::

       $ mscp ~/src-file 10.0.0.1:copied-file

Copy a local file and a directory to /tmp at a remote host:

::

       $ mscp ~/src-file dir1 10.0.0.1:/tmp

In a long fat network, following options might improve performance:

::

       $ mscp -n 64 -m 0xffff -a 64 -c aes128-gcm@openssh.com src 10.0.0.1:

**-n** increases the number of SSH connections than default, **-m** pins
threads to specific CPU cores, **-a** increases asynchronous inflight
SFTP WRITE/READ commands, and **-c aes128-gcm@openssh.com** will be
faster than the default chacha20-poly1305 cipher, particularly on hosts
that support AES-NI.
